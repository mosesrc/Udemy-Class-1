-My first Udemy course completed after doing Tech Talent South's Front-End development part time course! What an excellent course. Definitely learned a lot and was a great "moving forward piece" after finishing my first bootcamp class.

Problems/issues: 
- The autoprefix extension in VS code is giving me issues it seems that it is not working correctly; it did not autoprefix my CSS for main web browsers after I ran the ext.

-I need to fix the footer navigation in general, especially in devices 480px and below. I would like for things to be better spaced out and symmetrical when in 480px and above. And when 480px and below I would like for the footer navigation to be aligned in the middle with each row directly under the other.
